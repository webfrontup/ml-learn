Dear Miss Liang,

I am writing to thank you for your hard work for me. With your help, I make great progress in my study. A year ago, my study was bad and I didn’t want to learn, but you never give me up. You told me that I was clever. As long as I work hard, I would be great. In this year, you cared much about my study and helped me a lot. When I made mistakes, you always pointed them out and helped me to correct. Now, my study is much better than before, and I want to express my gratitude to you. Hope you everything goes well.
```

亲爱的梁老师：

您好！我写信是想要感谢你为我做出的努力。在你的帮助下，我在学习上取得了很大的进步。一年前，我的学习成绩很差，我不想再学习了，但是你从来没有放弃我。你告诉我我很聪明。只要努力，我一定很棒。近年，你很关心我的学习，帮了我很多。当我犯错的时候，你总是指出错误并帮我更正。现在，我的学习比以前好多了，我想向你表达我的感激。祝您一切顺利。

Last night, my mother told me that we would have a picnic with my uncle’s families in a park. I was so excited. The elders sat at the ground and talked about the work stuffs and family issues, while the children were playing around. My cousins and I went to the fairground. We took the pirate boat, which made us scream out loudly. I will never forget the feeling of taking the pirate boat. Besides, we also played other interesting activities. For me, it was a happy day. For my parents, I thought they were happy, too.

昨天晚上，我妈妈告诉我，我们要和我叔叔一家一起去公园野餐。我非常兴奋。大人们坐在地上，谈论着工作和家庭的事，而我们这些孩子们则在玩耍。我和我的表兄弟们去了游乐场，我们坐上了海盗船，吓得我们大声尖叫了出来。我永远都不会忘记在海盗船上的感觉。我们还去玩了其他有趣的活动。对于我来说，这是快乐的一天。对于我爸妈来说，我觉得他们也很高兴。
