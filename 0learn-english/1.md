Dear Miss Liang,

I am writing to thank you for your hard work for me. With your help, I make great progress in my study. A year ago, my study was bad and I didn’t want to learn, but you never give me up. You told me that I was clever. As long as I work hard, I would be great. In this year, you cared much about my study and helped me a lot. When I made mistakes, you always pointed them out and helped me to correct. Now, my study is much better than before, and I want to express my gratitude to you. Hope you everything goes well.
```

亲爱的梁老师：

您好！我写信是想要感谢你为我做出的努力。在你的帮助下，我在学习上取得了很大的进步。一年前，我的学习成绩很差，我不想再学习了，但是你从来没有放弃我。你告诉我我很聪明。只要努力，我一定很棒。近年，你很关心我的学习，帮了我很多。当我犯错的时候，你总是指出错误并帮我更正。现在，我的学习比以前好多了，我想向你表达我的感激。祝您一切顺利。
